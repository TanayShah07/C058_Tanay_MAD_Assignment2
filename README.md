# Firebase To-Do App

This project is an Android application developed as an assignment for the Mobile Application Development course at SVKM'S-NMIMS, Mumbai. The goal of this app is to demonstrate the use of Firebase Realtime Database for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a mobile application.

## Assignment Objectives
- Implement Firebase Realtime Database: The app uses Firebase as a cloud-hosted NoSQL database to store and synchronize to-do tasks in real-time.
- Perform CRUD Operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks.
- Priority-Based Task Management: Tasks are displayed in a RecyclerView and sorted by their priority (High, Medium, Low).

## Features
- Add a New Task: A floating action button allows users to add a new task with a description and a priority level.
- Real-time Display: The list of tasks updates automatically as new tasks are added or existing ones are modified in the database.
- Update Tasks: Double-tapping a task allows the user to edit its description and priority.
- Delete Tasks: Tasks can be easily deleted from the list with a simple swipe gesture.
- User Interface: The app features a clean, simple UI with a RecyclerView and CardView to present the tasks clearly.

## Technologies Used
- Android SDK
- Java
- Firebase Realtime Database
- AndroidX Libraries (RecyclerView, CardView, AppCompat)
